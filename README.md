<h1>Loan Prediction using ML Models</h1><br/>
This repository contains a Python implementation of a loan prediction project using various machine learning models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The project includes data preprocessing techniques such as dropping unneeded features, handling null values, scaling continuous variables and encoding categorical variables. Grid Search and Randomized Search are used for parameter tuning to improve the performance of the models.<br/>
The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on the provided data.<br/> 
The dataset used is publicly available and can be found in the repository. This project can be used as a reference for anyone looking to implement a similar loan prediction project.
